# KTH_Distributed-Systems
Distributed Systems (SF2568 ) 2020 Coding assignments

To run the code, run run.sh.
This will use the following files to do the simulation:
- main.cpp (here you can active/desactivate status updates and printing for plot)
- include/env.hpp (with all parameters that can changed)
- src/region.cpp
- src/person.cpp
- include/helper.cpp

The plots will be made using:
- plots/plot_hist.py (histogram)
- plots/visualize.py (video of people moving)

The plots will end up in a directory data/ (that needs to created before running the code)

Figures has some figures that were obtained with the code
